what is the genric in java

In Java, "generics" are a feature that allows programmers to write classes, interfaces, 
and methods that operate on different data types while providing compile-time type safety.
This means you can write a single generic class or method that works with any data type  
without losing type safety or needing to cast objects explicitly.
  
Generics enable code reusability and flexibility by using type parameters, 
typically denoted by angle brackets such as <T>. For example, a generic class 
Box<T> can hold objects of any type T, be it Integer, String, or any other type,
and the type is checked at compile time to avoid runtime errors.

Key points about Java generics:
They allow type parameters to be specified when defining classes, interfaces, or methods.
Enable type-safe collections and algorithms by specifying the types they operate on.
Prevent runtime class cast exceptions because type checking is done at compile time.
Improve code readability and maintainability by eliminating the need for explicit casting.

Example of a generic class:
